# Machine Learning Specialization

My code for Andrew Ng's online Machine Learning course assignments. It is a very popular, well-known course with over 3 million enrollements.

The link to the course is [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). It teaches the basics of ML, 
covering linear regression, logistic regression, basic linear algebra, regularization, neural networks, ML system design, SVMs, 
unsupervised learning, dimensionality reduction, anamoly detection, and recommender systems.

## Update

I completed about half of the course before moving on to other projects as I was starting college at the time. When I worked on this course in 2018-2019, it was one course. Since then, Coursera has split it up into the [Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction#courses) with three distinct courses. I ended up covering the equivalent of the first course and half the second course.
