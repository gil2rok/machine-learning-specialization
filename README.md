# Machine Learning Specialization

My code for Andrew Ng's online Machine Learning course assignments. It is a very popular, well-known course with over 3 million enrollements.

The link to the course is [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). It teaches the basics of ML, 
covering linear regression, logistic regression, basic linear algebra, regularization, neural networks, ML system design, SVMs, 
unsupervised learning, dimensionality reduction, anamoly detection, and recommender systems.

I'm currently halfway through.
